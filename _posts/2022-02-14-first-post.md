## This is an Example Post

I should write stuff here using Typora.



## Another Section Here

I could include command snippets like `import numpy as np`.

| Column A | Column B | Column C |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Item     | Item     | Item     |
| Item     | Item     | Item     |
| Item     | Item     | Item     |

Add a [link to the document](www.google.com), like this.

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

a = np.array([1,2,3])
```
